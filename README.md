# climate_news

This is the Final Project for my course in Data Science at WBS Coding School.

The main question is: "Are we really talking about Climate Change?"

To address it, I am gonna analyze the presence in the news of headlines related to Climate Change and the Environment.

At this moment, I am preparing a First-Iteration-MVP using the API of The Guardian.
Other routes of action could be: Google News, API for Climate Change News (also within The Guardian).
